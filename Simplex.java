    /**
     * Would it be better to use an array of tuples instead of 2-d array for inequalities to not write 0's for those with few variables?
     * Would an ArrayList of arrays be better for inequalities? No space used for 0's in data but ArrayList functionalities not needed.
     * Would it be preferable to have an array of relationships (index in array defines which inequality) rather than integer representation? I think array of relationships would be clearer.
